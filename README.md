Worldwide covid policy: exploration, analysis and modelling
==============================

September 2023

Introduction
------------ 
What did countries do to mitigate the effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus two (SARS‑CoV‑2) and the Covid-19 pandemic, and why? This project uses the opportunity of this rare 'global policy' event - nearly all countries addressing the same problem at the same time - and rich data on what governments around the world did during the pandemic, to compare and contrast the strategies undertaken. The results will hopefully increase understanding of the approaches that were available to policy-makers, which ones they choose, and what might have prompted them to do so.   

The project will answer the following questions to explore the actions take by governments around the world in their attempts to mitigate the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic:

1) What was the policy space available to governments?
2) Which parts of the policy space did governments use? 
3) Why did governments use parts of the policy space?   

The project treats policy approaches to the pandemic as taking place in almost a global policy laboratory, with policy-makers taking decisions in a mix of conditions local to them, but similar enough to those of many of their peers to be highly comparable. 

The outputs of the project will be a set of notebooks showing analysis and modelling; blogs on findings; and a summary report. 

Progress

[Blog on the policy tracking datasets in the Oxford Supertracker](https://medium.com/@lawrencebernardkay/what-data-is-there-on-covid-19-policy-across-the-world-2b8b49f2cfdf) that scopes the parameters of the data available - topics, timing, geographic coverage of the trackers and suchlike.

Next steps
------------

1) Uploading of draft literature and data review on Covid-19 policy undertaken by governments worldwide.   
2) Exploratory data analysis and modelling of the OxCGRT simplified datasets.
